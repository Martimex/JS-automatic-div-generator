# JS-automatic-div-generator
Template for creating automatic divs

[April 3th, 2021]
â€¢ This repo is created for a new Node.js weather forecasting project that will become available here soon.
It's a simple demonstration of div-autocreator that contains weather info about specific city.
Gonna add some animations and maybe create a simple landing page for a future Node project.
