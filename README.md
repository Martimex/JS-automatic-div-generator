# JS-automatic-div-generator
Template for creating automatic divs & weather app page

[April 3th, 2021]
• This repo is created for a new Node.js weather forecasting project that will become available here soon.
It's a simple demonstration of div-autocreator that contains weather info about specific city.
Gonna add some animations and maybe create a simple landing page for a future Node project.

• Added search input that lookup through the API in order to find requested city and give back an appropiate response.

• Worked a bit with some animations. That way hover effects has been added. Hovering over one of weather boxes will display
unique background depending on the weather in browsed city. Also, initial cities (these that user can see after the page is 
loaded) are getting randomly - every of them is a capital city by the way.
• Added simple hover animation for searchbar.
• Added 'last update' feature to inform user what was the last weather updates for cities.
• When user type city that already exists, or misspell/type wrong city name, appropiate notification will appear at the bottom of page.

• Managed the page, so that it can be also available for mobile devices. Added a bit of improvements for general user experience.
